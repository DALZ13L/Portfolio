          <p>Carl Sagan <i>(1934-1996)</i> was many things: planetary scientist, astrophysicist, tv personality, author, skeptic, and activist. But above all, he was a translator of the cosmos.</p>
          <p>His scientific contributions were formidable: Sagan asissted NASA on both the Voyager and Mariner missions, bettered our understanding of Venus and Neptune and demonstrated quantifiably how life could emerge on other planets. But it was his rare ability to make the universe speak in human terms that truly set him apart.</p> 
            <p><em>Cosmos</em>, released in 1980 made Sagan a mainstream international phenomena, broadcasting in 60 countries to an audience of over 500 million. It remains the gold standard in public education on cosmology and its cultural impact is still very much present, not least in the multiple generations of planetary scientists it inspired.</p>
          <p>Where others saw data, Carl Sagan saw poetry. He had a way of folding entire galaxies into the palm of your hand, of turning light-years into bedtime stories. Through his television work, books and countless talks and essays, he didn’t just explain science—he made it feel like home.</p>
          <p>Much of Sagan's work explored the potential for life beyond earth, and what discovering it could mean for our own understanding of ourselves. But he never let imagination outrun evidence. He held tight to the scientific method like a compass in the dark, insisting that wonder should be grounded, and truth, no matter how cold or inconvenient, was sacred.</p>
          <p>Sagan understood that science did not exist in a vacuum, and was deeply interwoven into politics, morality and spirituality. He was clear-eyed about the dangers we pose to ourselves as a species, and was an early voice on climate change as well as a staunch critic of nuclear weapons.</p>
          <p>He argued that the same technological progress that could doom us could also lift us, if only we chose curiosity over fear, cooperation over conflict, inquiry over ignorance.</p>
          <p>The universe appears vast, distant and abstract. But Sagan reminded us that 
"the cosmos is within us, we are made of star-stuff and are a way for the universe to know itself". He maintained that our long-term survival as a species will depend not on short sighted self-interest, but on compassion, clarity, and a universal perspective.</p>

            <p>"It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>“I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time... when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness."</blockquote>
